            <p>Apple's webpage is very crisp and clean looking. Inbetween each item they<br> 
                have a small amount of noticable white space. Each product lines up nicely <br>
                with the margins and things are simple and professional.

            <p>Simply Chocolate (in Denmark) does a wonderful job at demonstrating Visual Hierarchy. Immediently when you go on their site,
              your attention is Immediently captivated by the moving pictures and texts across the screen. They have their photos listed out and published in a way that
              doesn't take away from the product, but rather, enhances it.

                <p>Ameriica First Credit Union is a prime example of Hick's Law. As we've all learned in our beginning code classes,
                  "Keep It Simple Stupid". America First keeps their main menu (the three bars on the top right corner) small, and almost
                  unnoticable. The tabs and links that they want you to click are listed just below in a bright and easily read font. They 
                  draw attention towards what they want you to pay attention to, and minimize (or simplify) everything they don't particularly care 
                  if you click on.
