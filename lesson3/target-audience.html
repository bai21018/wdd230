    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This site is directed towards the citizens (and prospective citizens).</p>
    <h2>Two Personas</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;A current citizen, and a prospective citizen. Anyone who wants to move to Centerville will be able to come to this site and 
      search for any information they might want to find, as well as the ability to contact city hall for more direct questions.</p>
    <h2>Five Listed Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;"Where can I see upcoming events?" - Parents may want to see events taking place in this city to keep their family an 
              active part of the community.</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;"How do I know if the schools are good for my kids?" - When most people move, they like to see if the area they are 
              moving to has a good school system. Here would be an excellent place to detail out the different schools within the city/district.</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;"Where are some good places to hike? Ride my bike?" - Extra ciricular activities are absolutely key! No one wants to move to a place
              where the only activities you can do are inside or outside of the town.</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;"What are some small, local businesses around me?" - Sometimes people love to see local businesses. It helps people come togther and 
              establish themselves into the community.</li>
            <li>&emsp;&emsp;"City laws and declariations found in one neat, organized place in PDF format." - Say someone wants to know if it's legal to fire a crossbow in their backyard.
              Here would be an excellent place to list city laws and regulations, as well as any temporary type of declariations that may be issued on a case by case basis.</li>
